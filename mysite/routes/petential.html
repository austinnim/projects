            Description:
            This was a 10 week collaborative design project alongside 5 other UCSD students to examine a design context
            in order to find real world problems that can be explored through technological and representational opportunites that demonstrate
            a strong understanding of users and their actions. The context chosen to design within were animal shelters in San Diego, with the
            goal of improving the well-being of animals located in animal shelters. Initial research revolved around interviews and contextual inquiry
            to identify notable problems. Once data was gathered, models and diagrams were constructed to illustrate the interactivity between stakeholders and aspects of
            animal shelters. At the end of the 10 weeks, we were able to construct an interactive website prototype that detailed the functionality
            of the website.

            Primary - Potential adopters and pet owners
          </p>
          <p class="stakeholderInfo">
            Potential adopters and owners are an essential component to the pet adoption process.
            They are able to provide a consumer perspective and can identify possible
            benefits or falacies within the steps towards pet ownership. In addition, they provide
            unique experiences in their journey toward ownership that provides information on the
            imperatives that lead to the users decision.  Potential adoptees and owners have a great
            impact upon the animals finding a permanent home, thereby
            increasing the well-being of animals.
          </p>
          <!--
          We finalized our primary stakeholders being potential adopters and individuals who wish
          to become pet owners. This is because they have insight on what they believe should
          be prioritized the most in regards to adopting a pet, as well as a curious mindset that
          supplement all of ours in terms of how to adopt a pet and what follows.e ultimately felt that putting potential adopters into consideration
          and making them our primary stakeholders was significant, because we believe that
          they are a big component of our “why” -- to improve the lives of animals in shelters and
          help them find homes.
        -->
        <p class="stakeholderTitle">
          Secondary - Employees and volunteers
        </p>
        <p class="stakeholderInfo">
          Employees and volunteers have deep understanding of the animals well-being through direct interactions.
          In addition, they work within the context and are able to provide knowledge of operations within the shelter and the organizations.
          This provides an understanding of animal treatment within shelters and the
          tendencies among potential owners noticed by workers. Moreover, they have a direct
          impact upon the validity of the solution to determine the potential benefits.
        </p>
        <!--
        We initially wanted them to be our primary stakeholders,
        because they have direct interaction with the animals and can see how the animals are
        being taken care of on a more professional and personal level. We believed that we can
        gain useful insight from them to better expand the context of our problem, especially
        because they have direct experiences being in the shelter and its organization. We
        continued to keep these stakeholders into consideration in order to better understand
        the animals and how they are like and treated within shelters. We also felt that they can
        provide a different perspective, especially through their direct interactions and
        experiences seeing the animals.
      -->
      <p class="stakeholderTitle">
        Tertiary - Pet Owners
      </p>
      <p class="stakeholderInfo">
        Pet Owners provide context about the journey with their pets. This is important
        to understand the unpredictable highs and lows of pet ownership. In addition, they provide knowledge
        about unforseen events prior to either adoption or ownership.
        Ultimately, their experiences are valuable in understanding what needs to be done in order to become a pet owner.
      </p>
      <!--
      Lastly, we chose our tertiary stakeholders to be pet owners. One reason for this is because we believe that pet owners
      are people who have invested much of their time and money into having a pet. They are either knowledgeable or aware of
      the adoption process and other things that need to be done in order to adopt a pet. Their experiences are valuable in
      understanding what needs to be done in order to become a pet owner. Additionally, they may have visited shelters or
      have motivations that discouraged them from adopting their pet from a shelter, if they were to purchase them from a breeder.
      We believed that our tertiary stakeholders could provide a different perspective than potential adopters and shelter employees and volunteers.

    <h3>The Design Problem</h3>
    <p id="problemStatement">
      After visiting the San Diego Humane Society, Paws of Coronado, and Rancho Coastal Humane Society the
      issues centered around owner returns and overpopulation. Interviews with primary and tertiary stakeholders
      shed light upon differences in adoption process, lack of information, and inaccessibility. In order to tackle the collective as a whole we
      finalized the design problem towards a way to standardize the adoption process as well as educate users in pet ownership.
      In return this would result in reduction of owner returns and increased rate of interest for animals within shelters.

      <!--
      Our design problem was a combination of many different problems revolving around
      adoption and animal shelters, including different adoption processes, lack of information
      cards, poor website design, increase of owner returns and overpopulation, and specific
      financial issues with pet owners and potential adopters.

      To put it all together and make
      everything more cohesive, the specific problem we want to address is how the
      adoption process is different for each animal shelter, and how some potential
      adopters are not getting enough information about their pet beforehand.

      Specifically, we want to explore the adoption processes of different shelters, hoping to
      standardize different features of the adoption process and provide more information in
      order to educate potential animal owners about adoption, in hopes of reducing owner
      returns and increasing interest for all of the animals within the shelter.
