5. The static keyword means that the method can be accessed without initializing
an object of the class. For example, you would use a static method if you wanted

action on that parameter to produce an output.

subclasses that inherited from the superclass ShapeDrawer. This will help split
each shape into its own class with a method that overrides its superclass
methods. As a result of this the student can implement other methods that are
specific to each shape.
